I'm in a middle of learning js. So I just wanna make a simple thing which is basically about js. How to use it? All info has been added to the website. And play it by using console. At first give input 'quit'. Then open console and then use it.
It's not completed.
1. First give input "quit"
2. then open console and refresh the site again.
3. input "add" to add item, "list" to show your items, "quit" to quit
4. if you input "add" then add "item-name(anything)" it will be added. Then it will ask you to request. So if you wanna add again then again input "add".
5. now if you wanna see your item list simply input "list" as a request
6.Then you'll understand everything

**for deleting items simply input request "delete" then "item name that you added"

...........Enjoy..............
